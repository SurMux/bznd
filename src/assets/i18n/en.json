        "content": "Neurodiversity describes the fact that people have different brains and nervous systems. Neurotypical people perceive the world and sensory stimuli in a different way than neuroatypical people. They often perceive stimuli via sensory organs much more intense and richer. The reactions manifest, e.g., in intolerance of smells and food, unpleasant reactions to electromagnetic fields, and increased sensitivity to sound. In sum, people with a reduced or increased threshold of irritation. In addition to these aspects, there are numerous other special features. Neuroatypicality also includes, for example, ADHD, autism, dyscalculia, dyslexia, high sensitivity, or even high giftedness."
